# FrameSeeker

A PWA (or possibly an actual app) that allows you to view and save frames of a video.

To Do:

- [x] Hide seekbar (+ mabye controlls) when unfocused/tapped out of
- [x] get rid of download prompts, use storage api thing (not available on mobile API wise)
- [x] add a "jump to frame" textbox and button
- [ ] Fix frame number so its z-spaced based on video length
- [ ] 2x speed button?
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for navigation?
